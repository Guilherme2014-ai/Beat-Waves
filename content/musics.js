        lyrics: `I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
        Get along with the voices inside of my head
        You're tryin' to save me, stop holding your breath
        And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
        I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
        Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
        Wanted to receive attention for my music
        Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
        For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
        Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
        When I blew, see, but it was confusing
        'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
        Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (ooh)
        Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
        But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
        It was like winnin' a used mink
        Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
        I'm beginnin' to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
        Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
        But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
        I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
        Get along with the voices inside of my head
        You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
        And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        Now, I ain't much of a poet
        But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
        And don't squander it
        'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
        So I keep conjurin'
        Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
        Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
        No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
        Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
        I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
        And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
        'Cause I need an interventionist
        To intervene between me and this monster
        And save me from myself and all this conflict
        'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
        And I can't conquer it
        My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
        Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
        I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
        Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
        I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
        Get along with the voices inside of my head
        You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
        And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        Call me crazy, but I have this vision
        One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
        But until then, drums get killed and
        I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
        I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
        Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
        And shit to say back to the kids who played him
        I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
        But if one kid out of a hundred million
        Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates, that's great
        It's payback, Russell Wilson
        Falling way back in the draft
        Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
        Make that, straw into gold, chump, I will spin
        Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
        Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
        I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
        It's nothin', I'm still friends with the
        I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
        Get along with the voices inside of my head
        You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
        And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

        lyrics: `Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
        But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
        Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
        Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
        If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
        And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
        You are just what the doc ordered
        I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
        All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
        Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
        They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
        But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
        I got a laptop in my back pocket
        My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
        Got a fat knot from that rap profit
        Made a livin' and a killin' off it
        Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
        With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
        I'm an MC still as honest
        But as rude and as indecent as all hell
        Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
        This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
        You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
        With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
        Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
        And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
        I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
        Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
        Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
        How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
        Feel my wrath of attack
        Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
        It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
        While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
        'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
        All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
        Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
        Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
        Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
        Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
        Simply rage and youthful exuberance
        Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
        Hit the Earth like an asteroid
        Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
        MCs get taken to school with this music
        'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "Bus the rhyme"
        Now I lead a new school full of students
        Me? I'm a product of Rakim
        Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
        Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
        Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
        To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
        Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
        Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
        Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
        On the wall of shame
        You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
        Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
        Little gay-lookin' boy
        So gay, I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
        You're witnessin' a mass-occur
        Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
        "Oy vey, that boy's gay!" That's all they say, lookin' boy
        You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
        And a "Way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
        Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
        I get a "Hell, yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
        I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
        Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
        Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
        Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-
        I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
        All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
        The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
        Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
        Kneel before General Zod
        This planet's Krypton-, no, Asgard, Asgard
        So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
        You rodent, I'm omnipotent
        Let off, then I'm reloadin'
        Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
        And I should not be woken
        I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
        But I got your mom deep-throatin'
        I'm out my Ramen Noodle
        We have nothin' in common, poodle
        I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
        It's me, my honesty's brutal
        But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
        For good at least once in a while
        So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
        To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
        But I gotta keep a few punchlines
        Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
        Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
        I know there was a time where once I
        Was king of the underground
        But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
        So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
        Appeal with the skin color of mine
        You get too big and here they come tryin'
        To censor you like that one line
        I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
        Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
        Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9
        See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
        Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
        You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
        And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
        You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
        You write normal? Fuck being normal!
        And I just bought a new raygun from the future
        Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
        'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
        Singin' to a man while he played piano
        Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel
        So Ray J went straight to the radio station
        The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
        Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
        Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
        What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
        Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything
        You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
        I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
        How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
        Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
        For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
        'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
        I make elevating music, you make elevator music
        "Oh, he's too mainstream"
        Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
        "It's not hip-hop, it's pop, " 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
        With rock, shock rap with Doc
        Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
        I don't know how to make songs like that
        I don't know what words to use
        Let me know when it occurs to you
        While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
        It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
        How many verses I gotta murder to
        Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
        Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
        But look at the accolades these skills brung me
        Full of myself, but still hungry
        I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
        And I'm a million leagues above you
        Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
        I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
        I'ma sleep in the front seat
        Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
        But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
        Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
        They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
        But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
        I have, then you may be a little patient
        And more sympathetic to the situation
        And understand the discrimination
        But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
        But if I can't batter the women
        How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
        Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
        If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
        To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
        Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not
        Why be a king when you can be a god?`,

        bio: `Little Dark Age (abbreviated as LDA[6]) is the fourth studio album by the American rock band MGMT, released on February 9, 2018, through Columbia Records.[7][8] It is the band's first album of new material in nearly five years, after the release of their eponymous third studio album in September 2013.

        After the band concluded touring at the end of 2014, members Andrew VanWyngarden and Benjamin Goldwasser took time off for most of 2015 before regrouping at the end of the year. The album was produced by the band with Patrick Wimberly and longtime collaborator Dave Fridmann.`,
        lyrics: `Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
        The ruins of the day painted with a scar
        And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
        The feelings start to rot, one wink at a time
        Oh-oh, forgiving who you are, for what you stand to gain
        Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
        When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
        Horrified with each stone on the stage, my little dark age
        Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
        The carvings on the face say they find it hard
        And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
        The humor's not the same, coming from denial
        Oh-oh, I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
        I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
        If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
        Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age
        I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
        You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
        If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing all alone
        Horrified on the stage, my little dark age
        Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
        The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind
        Policemen swear to God, love seeping from their guns
        I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
        If you get out of bed, come find us heading for the bridge
        Bring a stone, all the rage, my little dark age
        I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
        I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
        If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
        Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age
        All alone, open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age`,

        lyrics: `I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
        When the world gives you a raw deal
        Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
        When it talks to you like you don't belong
        Or tells you you're in the wrong field
        When something's in your mitochondrial
        'Cause it latched on to you, like-
        Knock knock, let the devil in
        Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
        This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
        L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
        Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
        Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
        Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
        Of elephant manure, hell, I meant Kahlúa
        Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
        And blew up my-my-myself again
        Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
        Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
        Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
        How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
        Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
        Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
        And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
        And I know they're gonna hate
        But I don't care, I barely can wait
        To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
        Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
        Because they're gonna taste my-
        Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
        And I'm not knowin' when I'm
        Ever gonna slow up and I'm
        Ready to snap any moment I'm
        Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
        They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
        (W-W-When they get bit with the-)

        They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
        (W-W-When they get bit with the-)
        I said knock knock, let the devil in
        Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
        Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
        It-it's evident I'm not done
        V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
        Like a web and you just caught in 'em
        Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
        Beat strangler attack
        So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
        Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
        Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
        Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
        Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
        My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
        With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
        Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
        Translation, I will probably kill us both
        When I end up backin' into ya
        You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya

        I said knock knock, let the devil in
        Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
        Ain't no telling when this chokehold
        On this game will end, I'm loco
        Became a Symbiote, so
        My fangs are in your throat, hoe
        You're snake-bitten with my, venom
        With the ballpoint pen I'm
        Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
        Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
        Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
        Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
        'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
        Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
        Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
        Chased it with straight liquor
        Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
        And awake with a headache
        And I take anything in rectangular shape
        Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
        'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
        So escapin' me is impossible
        I latch onto you like a parasite
        And I probably ruined your parents' life
        And your childhood too
        'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
        I'm responsible for you retarded fools
        I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
        You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
        And I'm the suit, so call me-
