        bio: `Little Dark Age (abbreviated as LDA[6]) is the fourth studio album by the American rock band MGMT, released on February 9, 2018, through Columbia Records.[7][8] It is the band's first album of new material in nearly five years, after the release of their eponymous third studio album in September 2013.

        After the band concluded touring at the end of 2014, members Andrew VanWyngarden and Benjamin Goldwasser took time off for most of 2015 before regrouping at the end of the year. The album was produced by the band with Patrick Wimberly and longtime collaborator Dave Fridmann.`,
        lyrics: `Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
        The ruins of the day painted with a scar
        And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
        The feelings start to rot, one wink at a time
        Oh-oh, forgiving who you are, for what you stand to gain
        Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
        When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
        Horrified with each stone on the stage, my little dark age
        Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
        The carvings on the face say they find it hard
        And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
        The humor's not the same, coming from denial
        Oh-oh, I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
        I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
        If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
        Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age
        I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
        You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
        If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing all alone
        Horrified on the stage, my little dark age
        Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
        The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind
        Policemen swear to God, love seeping from their guns
        I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
        If you get out of bed, come find us heading for the bridge
        Bring a stone, all the rage, my little dark age
        I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
        I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
        If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
        Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age
        All alone, open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age`,

        I'ma feed you to the wolves when you get nasty back at me
        But baby, don't distract me
        I'm a goner, I lost her
        Like, why the hell you wanna play me that way?
        You're bad, babe, you double-faced entendre

        I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I'll light this place on fire
        I want it, I'm on it, but babe, at least, I'm honest
        I get tired of explaining
        As these seasons keep on changing
        Life goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and
        On, and on, and on (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
